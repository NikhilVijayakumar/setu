### 1\. Introduction

This document specifies the Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) for **Project Setu**. These requirements define the quality attributes and operational characteristics of the library. Adhering to these NFRs is critical to ensure that Setu is robust, secure, efficient, and easy for developers to use and maintain.

### 2\. Performance

Performance requirements focus on the efficiency and responsiveness of the library's operations. The library itself should add minimal overhead to the underlying service calls.

  - **NFR-PERF-01: Low Latency Overhead:** The processing overhead introduced by the Setu library for any given function call must not exceed **20 milliseconds** over the direct call to the underlying service's SDK.
  - **NFR-PERF-02: Connection Management:** The library must efficiently manage persistent connections (where applicable, e.g., to a database or service client) to minimize the latency associated with connection setup on repeated calls.
  - **NFR-PERF-03: Memory Footprint:** The library's baseline memory usage upon initialization should be minimal. The memory usage should scale predictably with the size of the data being processed (e.g., file uploads/downloads).

### 3\. Reliability and Availability

Reliability ensures the library operates correctly and consistently. As a library, its availability is tied to the application that hosts it, but it must be resilient to failures in the services it connects to.

  - **NFR-REL-01: Graceful Error Handling:** The library must never crash the consuming application. All interactions with external services must be wrapped in robust error handling.
  - **NFR-REL-02: Clear Exception Propagation:** When an external service fails or returns an error, the library must catch the underlying exception and propagate it as a clear, documented, custom exception (e.g., `StorageServiceError`, `AuthenticationError`). This allows the consuming application to handle failures gracefully.
  - **NFR-REL-03: Connection Retries:** For transient network errors, the library should support a configurable mechanism for connection retries with exponential backoff.

### 4\. Security

Security is paramount, especially as the library will operate as a bridge to critical services.

  - **NFR-SEC-01: No Secret Storage:** The library **must not** store any secrets (API keys, passwords, connection strings) within its own code.
  - **NFR-SEC-02: Secure Configuration Handling:** All sensitive configuration data must be passed to the library at runtime from the consuming application's environment. The library must not log sensitive data.
  - **NFR-SEC-03: Dependency Security:** The library must not have any known critical or high-severity vulnerabilities in its third-party dependencies. Dependencies should be regularly scanned using tools like `pip-audit` or Snyk.
  - **NFR-SEC-04: Input Sanitization:** While the library is not the primary point of input, it should not introduce vulnerabilities. It will operate on the assumption that the consuming application has sanitized user-provided data.

### 5\. Scalability

The library must be designed to function effectively within applications that scale to handle high load.

  - **NFR-SCAL-01: Stateless Operations:** The library's service adapters should be stateless wherever possible. This ensures that in a horizontally scaled environment (e.g., multiple Docker containers running the same application), any instance of the library can handle any request without relying on local state from a previous request.
  - **NFR-SCAL-02: Concurrency-Safe:** The library must be safe to use in multi-threaded and asynchronous application environments.

### 6\. Maintainability and Extensibility

The architecture must support ease of maintenance and future enhancements. This is a core goal of the project.

  - **NFR-MAIN-01: High Test Coverage:** All core logic and adapters must have a high degree of unit test coverage (target \> 90%).
  - **NFR-MAIN-02: Modular Design (Pluggable Adapters):** The architecture must allow for adding a new service implementation (e.g., an adapter for AWS S3) without modifying the core domain logic or existing adapters.
  - **NFR-MAIN-03: Adherence to Coding Standards:** The codebase must adhere to standard Python coding conventions (PEP 8) and be formatted and linted automatically.
  - **NFR-MAIN-04: Semantic Versioning:** The library must follow Semantic Versioning 2.0.0. Breaking changes must only be introduced in major version releases.

### 7\. Usability (Developer Experience)

The library must be simple and intuitive for application developers to use.

  - **NFR-DX-01: Comprehensive Documentation:** The project must include clear documentation covering installation, configuration for each adapter, and code examples for every public function.
  - **NFR-DX-02: Simple API Surface:** The public-facing API should be clean, intuitive, and well-documented with type hints and docstrings.
  - **NFR-DX-03: Easy Initialization:** The library should be simple to initialize and configure within a consuming application.

### 8\. Compatibility

  - **NFR-COMP-01: Python Version Support:** The library must be compatible with Python 3.8 and newer versions.
  - **NFR-COMP-02: OS Independence:** The library must be operating system independent and run on any OS that Python supports (Linux, macOS, Windows).

### 9\. Logging and Monitoring

  - **NFR-LOG-01: Structured Logging:** The library should use Python's standard `logging` module. It should not configure the root logger itself but allow the consuming application to configure log levels and handlers.
  - **NFR-LOG-02: Actionable Log Messages:** Logs should be structured and provide sufficient context (e.g., service name, function called) to be useful for debugging without logging sensitive data.
